cwru_tour
=========

This is the senior project for Eric Vennaro, Sean Corcoran, and Heath Hudgins. The CWRU Tour app will consist of several different tours for Case Western Reserve University. The University can use this iOS application to increase the visibility of the university. This app will benefit all visitors to the university rather than just undergraduate students.

In order to run this code open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode.
