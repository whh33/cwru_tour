	<font size=4><strong>University Circle</strong></font>
		<font size=2><p>Five miles east of downtown Cleveland, University Circle is one of the city's most energetic and culturally robust communities. It's anchored by Case Western Reserve University and enhances the urban campus experience with some of the nation's best arts, music, historical and medical institutions.</p>
		<p>University Circle boasts 550 parklike acres nestled in a vibrant urban environment. It's a short walk from the center of campus to the world-renowned Cleveland Orchestra at Severance Hall, the Cleveland Museum of Art, botanical garden or natural history museum. Students cross-register at the Cleveland Institute of Art and the Cleveland Institute of Music, whose buildings mingle with the university's north campus. Meanwhile, dozens of the country's <strong>best medical centers</strong> - Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth and University Hospitals of Cleveland - call the area home.</p>
		<p><strong>And that's just the start.</strong> Cleveland's Little Italy bustles just off campus and leads to various food, shopping and nightlife spots - Coventry, Shaker Square and Cedar-Lee, to name a few - in the nearby Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights communities.</p></font>
		
		<font size=4><strong>Cleveland, Ohio</strong></font>
        <font size=2><p><strong>Exciting yet intimate</strong>, Cleveland is a mid-sized city that boomed in the early 20th century and is experiencing a renaissance that began with sports venues downtown and continues with revitalized historical neighborhoods on the west side and a burgeoning corridor between the city's center and the east side.</p>
		<p>The worldwide food press has hailed Cleveland as the "hot new dining city," with top nods for new restaurants, farm-to-table operations, ethnic foods and neighborhood eateries, while a number of the city's arts communities, including Tremont, Ohio City and Collinwood, have garnered national attention.</p>
		<p><strong>Ranked as one of the country's most livable cities</strong>, Cleveland gets high marks for thriving healthcare and biotechnology industries, the lively arts scene, cost of living and four-seasons climate, not to mention a wealth of natural resources. Lake Erie and the "Emerald Necklace", a system of nature preserves, comprise Cleveland's big backyard and make for optimal outdoor living. The Cleveland Metroparks feature miles of running and hiking trails, bridle paths, ball fields and nature centers. The parks dot and span much of Northeast Ohio, so <strong>a trip from the city to nature is only a few minutes away</strong>.</p>
		<p>Alongside being home to one of the nation's top universities and the best college in Ohio, Cleveland is a big sports fan. The Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, Cleveland Browns football team and Cleveland Indians baseball team play in venues downtown. And each year during commencement, graduates and their families can see the Cleveland Marathon racing through the city.</p>
		<p>Numerous other professional, amateur and leisure sports activities - from minor-league baseball and arena football to corporate softball and triathlons - are in play around Northeast Ohio at any moment, offering <strong>countless opportunities</strong> to watch, play, win or just catch some of the city's energy.</p>
