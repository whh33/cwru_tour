Beta Theta Pi^41.502579^-81.601628^41.502708^-81.601859^The local chapter of Beta Theta Pi has a unique reason for choosing the Lamda Kappa - Beta chapter designation. Although the fraternity was founded on August 9th, 1841 at Western Reserve University as the second official chapter of the fraternity, it went through several delineations before the founders of the current chapter re-founded it at WRU. The founders originally were part of an organization called the Lyme Kill Club. Although the origin of this name is unclear, the club members petitioned to be part of Beta Theta Pi, and once accepted, took the Lamda Kappa designation to remember their origins as the Lyme Kill Club and the Beta designation to recognize their place in their fraternities history. With the merging of Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University in 1967, there were originally two different chapters of Beta Theta Pi. It took almost a full ten years before the chapters merged. Today, Beta, the chapter's nickname, members can be seen sporting pink and blue swag.

In order to print, you simply have to print from any WiFi-connected device with the printer software (laptops, smart phones etc) and go to any of the WEPA printer stations on campus, swipe your Campus ID card, and select the document to print. Because every station is connected to the internet, you can print from your residence hall, and pick up the assignment on the Quad.
Kent Hale Smith Building^41.503292^-81.606626^41.503758^-81.606052^Kent Hale Smith is home to the Macromolecular Science and Engineering Department. Macromolecular science is the study of the synthesis, structure, processing, properties and use of polymers including plastics, fibers, rubber, films and much more. CWRU was the first university in the country to not only offer this field of study as an undergraduate major but also to have a department for education and research of polymers and remains recognized around the world as one of the best polymer programs in the existence. Students, both graduate and undergraduate, receive the unique opportunity to both to participate in groundbreaking research, but also learn skills highly applicable to modern industry. Because approximately 70% of all graduates in the chemical sciences field are employed in some aspect of polymer production, macromolecular science and engineering puts students in the perfect position to take jobs out of school. Undergraduates graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering and at the graduate level, students graduate with either a Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy.
Kusch House^41.500765^-81.600116^41.500933^-81.600395^The six story Kusch House is a part of the Second Year Living Program and is located on the top of the hill. Every second year student is required to live on campus, whether that is in a second year apartment or a Greek house.

Just like first-year students, second-year students have the choice of choosing their roommates or being put into a random suite. Students who choose to go into the lottery for a random room will only be placed in a single-sex suite, however, male and female students are allowed to live in the same suite.

Just as students are required to live on campus for two years, students are also required to be on the meal plan for two years. There are several options for meal plans including having 17 meals a week, 19 meals a week, and 200 meals a semester. As students are on campus for longer, their choices increase. All meal plans also come with Case Cash, which is like a debit cart, and can be used at most local restaurants. Case Case rolls over from one semester to the next and can be supplemented at any time. In addition to the dining hall, Leutner Commons also contains L3 (Lower Level Leunter) which is the late-night dining option here on CWRU campus.

The building was build in the 1920's for the Mather College for Women, and has ever since head departments relating to the arts and sciences. If you look at the side of the building facing Euclid Avenue, you might notice an oddly-sized door without a handle. Believe it or not, people love to use this door from the inside. Yes, that's right, it is an actual door.
Mather Memorial Building^41.509569^-81.606931^41.509798^-81.607425^"Home to the -ologies: sociology, psychology, philosophy - as well as several other departments in the College of Arts and Sciences. As with all classes, students majoring in anything from dance or nursing to chemical engineering or biology can take humanities. In fact, most non-humanities majors are required to take a certain number of humanities credits. An especially popular class is criminology, where you may or may not learn why OJ did it. Mather Memorial is also home WRUW, Case Western Reserve University's radio station, Cleveland's Most Eclectic. It gets the "eclectic" tag because any student at CWRU can become a DJ, they simply have to shadow a current DJ for a semester, then they get their own time slot. Overheard in the freshman residence halls: Person A:"Hey, Joe, I've got my own radio time slot." Person B: "That's fantastic, John, I'll definitely tune in. When is it?". Person A: "3:00am-4:00am." Person B: "Thanks, but no thanks!". Seniority at its finest it seems."

Merging Fountain^41.508992^-81.608073^41.508975^-81.607857^"The fountain entitled "Merging" was created to symbolize the merging of Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University in 1967. More commonly called the Wet-Dry Fountain because half of the steps are covered in water while the other half are completely dry, the fountain sits in the middle of the Mather Quad, the smaller sister quad to the Main Quad. Some say that CIT and WRU merged to combine two dominant football teams (joke!), but the truth is completely academic. Because the two institutions had been collaborating more and more due their proximity. Clearly, the merging ended up positively, as CWRU has developed into a stronger institution than either institution could have been on their own."
