These tours are offered at set times during the week. In order to provide more consistent access to campus tours, this was created to provide self-guided tours to the Universityâ€™s visitors, helping to provide them with a better on-campus experience.\n\n\tThis product provides ancillary services to compliment the self-guided tour. It currently functions in two different modes. The user can either walk around campus on their own, and have the application give them information about relevant university destinations or the user can go on a predetermined tour route. The length and destination of the tour can be changed based on what the visitor is interested. The app will also be able to schedule tours and interviews directly with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.";
