    <p><strong>Getting involved in university life at Case Western Reserve</strong> is the best way for undergraduates, graduate and professional students, faculty, staff and alumni to integrate themselves into the fabric of our diverse community.</p>
    <p>Opportunities abound for cultural, academic, social and athletic activities on this campus. If you're not attending a lecture or exhibition put on by one of the university's schools or departments, catching a lunchtime grill at Crawford Hall or cheering on one of our winning sports teams, you still have worlds to explore within walking distance (or a short bus ride away). University Circle <strong>surrounds campus with the world's best in arts, music and history</strong>, while neighborhoods all over Cleveland offer a robust menu of cultural fare.</p>
    <p>But university life at Case Western Reserve is more than just taking it all in. <strong>We like to give back too.</strong></p>
    <p>Campuswide events, like Case for Community Day, enable our faculty, staff, students and alumni to <strong>connect with our neighbors</strong> while demonstrating the synergy between higher education and service to society. Meanwhile university groups, like the Center for Civic Engagement and Learning keeps the spirit (and service) of difference-making alive all year long.</p>
    <p>When we finally do go inside, Case Western Reserve students, faculty and staff have access to a top university library network, some of the <strong>highest-tech classrooms</strong>, enviable athletic facilities and university housing that's setting new standards as much for undergraduate living as sustainability.</p>
